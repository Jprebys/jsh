# JSH

Here I will be implementing a shell program in pure C. I am doing this to more familiarize myself with building a large project in C, and I think it lends itself well to adding arbitrary new features as I think of them. 


#### Currently supported commands:

- cd : Change current working directory
- cal: Display current month calendar
- Any unix command available on your system


#### Built and tested using:
Ubuntu 22.04
GCC 11.2.0
GNU Make 4.3
Tilix terminal 1.9.4
